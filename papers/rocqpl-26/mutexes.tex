\section{Introduction}
Mechanized concurrent separation logic has advanced to the stage where we can prove correctness of programs in real languages, using tools like VST~\cite{vst}, BRiCk~\cite{brick}, or RustBelt~\cite{rustbelt}. One way of making this useful to programmers is to verify commonly-used concurrency infrastructure in those languages (e.g., the ARC in Rust), thus increasing the assurance of a wide swath of real-world code. Here, we report our progresson on an effort to verify C++'s concurrency support library~\cite{} using BRiCk. Some parts of this library, like mutexes and thread creation, are familiar from prior work in Iris, but there are also many patterns that are commonplace in C++ but have not previously been analyzed in separation logic. In this abstract, we specifically address \emph{recursive mutexes}.

The recursive mutex is a variant of the standard mutex/lock that can be acquired multiple times by the same thread, and must be released the same number of times before it becomes available to other threads. This allows methods to acquire a lock before using the associated resources, whether or not the calling thread already owns the lock, as long as they release it before returning. (example, further motivation).

\section{Specifying the recursive mutex}
%skip the atomic version entirely, present the invariant-style specification and a borrowing lemma letting you get P out of holds, then note that it's implemented using a logically atomic spec
The standard separation logic specification for a mutex/lock associates a lock $\ell$ with resources $P$ (the ``lock invariant''), represented as $\mathsf{is\_lock}(\ell, P)$. The acquire and release functions are then specified by:
\begin{mathpar}
\{\mathsf{is\_lock}(\ell, P)\}\ \texttt{acquire}(\ell)\ \{\mathsf{is\_lock}(\ell, P) \ast P\}

\{\mathsf{is\_lock}(\ell, P)\} \ast P\}\ \texttt{release}(\ell)\ \{\mathsf{is\_lock}(\ell, P)\}
\end{mathpar}
\noindent A thread that acquires the lock gains access to the protected resources, and gives them up upon release. Our goal is to state similar specifications for recursive mutexes. The key points are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A fractional \emph{handle} $\ell \mapsto_q \mutexR\ \gamma\ P$ that is held by each thread that knows about the recursive mutex $\gamma$ with invariant $P$.
\item A predicate $\mathsf{holds}\ \gamma\ t\ n\ P$ indicating that thread $t$ has acquired mutex $\gamma$ with invariant $P$ $n$ times. When $n$ is 0, $t$ does not hold the mutex; when $n$ is greater than 0, it does, and should have access to $P$.
\end{itemize}%We probably don't need P in both \mutexR and \mathsf{holds}.
The main difference from the simple lock is that every thread that might interact with mutex $\gamma$, whether it currently holds it or not, has its own $\mathsf{holds}\ \gamma\ t\ n\ P$ assertion; $n$ is simply 0 for any thread that does not currently hold the mutex. 
The mutual exclusion property is reflected by the fact that $\mathsf{holds}\ \gamma\ t_1\ n_1\ P \ast \mathsf{holds}\ \gamma\ t_2\ n_2\ P \vdash n_1 = 0 \vee n_2 = 0$, i.e., at most one thread holds the mutex at a time.
Furthermore, it is vital that there is only one $\mathsf{holds}$ predicate per thread; otherwise, %I forget why this is important -- probably to do with borrowing
. Thus, the $\mathsf{holds}$ predicate must also satisfy $\mathsf{holds}\ \gamma\ t\ n_1\ P \ast \mathsf{holds}\ \gamma\ t\ n_2\ P \vdash \mathsf{False}$. %other important details...

From a programmer's perspective, the key feature of a recursive mutex is that we hold the protected resources after acquiring it, whether or not we held them before. Thus, our specs should let us conclude that we own the invariant after a call to \texttt{acquire} without requiring case analysis on whether we already hold the lock. Our specifications allow this by simply saying that \texttt{acquire} increases $n$ and \texttt{release} decreases it:
\begin{mathpar}
\{\ell \mapsto \mutexR\ \gamma\ q \ast \mathsf{holds}\ \gamma\ t\ n\ P\}\vspace{-.8em}\\ \vspace{-.8em}
\texttt{acquire}(\ell)\\
\{\ell \mapsto \mutexR\ \gamma\ q \ast \mathsf{holds}\ \gamma\ t\ (n + 1)\ P\}

\{\ell \mapsto \mutexR\ \gamma\ q \ast \mathsf{holds}\ \gamma\ t\ (n + 1)\ P\}\vspace{-.8em}\\ \vspace{-.8em}
\texttt{release}(\ell)\\
\{\ell \mapsto \mutexR\ \gamma\ q \ast \mathsf{holds}\ \gamma\ t\ n\ P\}
\end{mathpar}
\noindent These specifications implicitly say that if $n$ was 0 before an \texttt{acquire}, then afterwards $t$ gains ownership of $P$, and if $n$ is 0 after a \texttt{release}, then $t$ gave up ownership of $P$. However, these are not special cases in the specs---instead, threads may free acquire and release $\ell$, incrementing and decrementing their counts $n$, and then extract $P$ from $\mathsf{holds}$ whenever they can show that $n$ is greater than 0. This allows proofs that follow the standard use pattern of recursive mutexes: whenever a thread needs access to $P$, it first acquires the mutex regardless of whether it already held it, and then releases it once finished, returning it to whatever count $n$ it was at previously.

The final piece is the ``borrowing'' rule that allows a thread to obtain the invariant $P$ if it holds the lock:
\begin{align*}
n > 0 \Rightarrow\ &\ell \mapsto \mutexR\ \gamma\ q \ast \mathsf{holds}\ \gamma\ t\ n\ P \vsE \\&\ell \mapsto \mutexR\ \gamma\ q \ast P \ast \mathsf{held}\ \gamma\ t\ n
\end{align*}
\noindent A thread can exchange its positive $\mathsf{holds}$ predicate for ownership of $P$, plus a retainer $\mathsf{held}$ that tracks $n$ but does not give access to $P$. This exchange operation is a view shift because it is implemented via an invariant~\cite{iris}, but this is mostly irrelevant from the user's perspective%elaborate
. Essentially, while the standard lock acquire spec simultaneously acquires the lock and gives the thread ownership of $P$, our recursive mutex specs separate these operations into two steps, incrementing $n$ on acquire and then letting the thread obtain $P$ at any later point, as long as $n$ is greater than 0. Since $\mathsf{holds}$ is part of the precondition of \texttt{release}, the thread must return $P$ before releasing the lock, whether or not the release actually sets $n$ to 0. %more on this, and the fixed-argument trick
